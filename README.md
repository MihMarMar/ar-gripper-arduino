# ar-gripper-arduino
This is the orientation project for an adaptive robots minor.

The gripper is controlled by a single servo. 
The gripper also has a pressure sensor which provides feedback for the grip strength.

The robot arm is going to either be UR5 or Collarobot. The arm can communicate with the microcontroller through a serial interface.

This is a WIP project, there is still no physical prototype so assumptions are made about how the sensors, servos, arm behaves. 

The robotic arm that will hold the gripper is still unknown so it is assumed that it will communicate through a serial interface, but this might not be true in the final product.
